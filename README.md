## Description 

Pets Remain In High Demand During COVID. An estimated 11 million U.S. households have gotten a new pet during the pandemic. 
We wanted an easy and fun way to  help our pet friends meet other pet friends (with Human plus 1â€™s tagging along of course). 

As an adorable pet, I want to meet other pet friends so that I can have play dates with them at the park, or anywhere fun!

## About This Boilerplate

The MERN boilerplate is for MongoExpressReactNode allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

For seeding your database run

``` 
npm run seed
```

## Deployment (Heroku)

The project is deployed on [Social Pooch on Heroku](https://secure-fjord-72458.herokuapp.com/findpetfriends)

You can find the Social Pooch Repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/mklakhan/social-pooch).
